Purpose: The application extends the functionality of Robocopy.exe to obtain the possibility for copying a selected range of files/directories in a root directory, what is impossible with Robocopy.exe.

For instance:

Root directory --> root
in root ---------> sub1, sub2 with some files

Robocopy enables only a selection of particular files (not directories) or
of the whole content of root

This app enables you to specify particular 
subdirectories like sub1 or sub2 for copying
